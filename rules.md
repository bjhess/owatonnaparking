# Rules of Owatonna Street Parking

[The city rules](http://ci.owatonna.mn.us/514/Public-Winter-Parking):

* Park your vehicle on alternate sides every night, from November 15 to March 31
* The calendar date is the date starting at 12:01am to noon, so likely the date following the night you parked
* On even-numbered calendar dates, vehicles may be parked on the side of the street with even-numbered lots/houses.
* On odd-numbered calendar dates, vehicles may be parked on the side of the street with odd-numbered lots/houses.

These rules don't really apply to the purpose of this site:

* Does not apply to any street where parking is limited to one side, to any cul-de-sac that has combined even and odd house numbers, nor to any street that has more restrictive parking requirements.
